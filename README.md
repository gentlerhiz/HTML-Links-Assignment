### HTML Links Assignment

#### Objective:
To practice creating various types of links using HTML.

#### Instructions:
1. Create a new HTML file named `index.html`.
2. Within the HTML file, create a basic HTML structure that includes a `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
3. Inside the `<head>` tag, include a `<title>` tag with the content "HTML Links Assignment".

#### Tasks:

1. **Basic Link:**
   - Create a link that navigates to an external website of your choice. For example, create a link to "https://www.example.com".

2. **Anchor Link:**
   - Within the same HTML file, create a section with a heading `<h2>` that says "Section 1".
   - Create another link at the top of the page that navigates to this section using an anchor link.

3. **Link that Opens in a New Tab:**
   - Create a link to another website (different from the one used in task 1) that opens in a new tab. For example, create a link to "https://www.anotherexample.com" that opens in a new tab.

4. **Same Website, Different Page:**
   - Create a second HTML file named `page2.html` with the following content:
     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
     <head>
         <title>Page 2</title>
     </head>
     <body>
         <h1>Welcome to Page 2</h1>
         <p>This is another page on the same website.</p>
     </body>
     </html>
     ```
   - In your `index.html` file, create a link that navigates to `page2.html`.

5. **Link Back to Home Page:**
   - In `page2.html`, create a link that navigates back to the home page (`index.html`).

### Submission:
Please submit both `index.html` and `page2.html` files.

### Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct usage of HTML tags and attributes.
- Functionality of all types of links.
